<h2 class="mywork-imgtext">GAMEPLAY</h2>
<p class="mywork-text">GAMEPLAY:  
When we start the game there are two options that we get along with the title the first option is to start the game which is basically a button node created in Godot and the second one is to quit the game. 
If you press the start game button it will bring up a level button along with a sign that says good luck and there is an icon representing a gun with a target and some bullets this is the final menu screen that
we encounter and after we press this button the main game starts There is another option called the back button which when pressed will take us one menu back to the start game menu   
  
SOUNDS :  
The song that we used for the gameplay is called Go Corona Remix Rap. This rap is in form of an awareness on what to do in order to stop the spread of this pandemic. It encourages the users to take precautions like staying at home, not going out, watching Netflix to spend time and so on. You can hear this song along with lyrics on this link. This is a really good rap : <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cspF9QK5FlA "> SONG </a>   
  
The main menu theme is inspired from the recently trending meme on social media called COFFIN GUY MEME. This is a song that a few funeral service guys performed in Ghana, Africa during a funeral service. We decided to include it because it is energetic and also, WE LIKE IT     Here is a link for it:   <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cspF9QK5FlA "> CLICK HERE </a>

 <h2 class="mywork-imgtext">MAIN LEVEL</h2>
 <p class="mywork-text">  
PLAYER VISUALS and INTERACTIVITY:  
The main level includes the main players spawning at the centre of the game there are total of four barriers which act as a shield from the turrets that are attached to the four different walls of the level. Turrets are coded in such a manner that when the player comes into its range they start shooting.   
If you consider the animations of the player we can see the changing of weapons on either using a scroll bar from the mouse or pressing 1 2 3 or 4 to make him unarmed, give knife, a pistol or a machine gun respectively. There are reload animation when the magazine of the gun empties. The camera moves faster if we use the shift key to sprint. The mouse can be used to move the camera around. When we jump, there is a slight increase in the camera height as is the case with many FPS games, to symbolise that the jump has occurred. Player can also pick up the AMMO and HEALTH pickups. </p>
 
  <h2 class="mywork-imgtext">TURRETS</h2>
 <p class="mywork-text">The turrets can shoot at us. This function has been implemented using the Turret.gd script. Refer to the code for more information on the technical side. 
 The turrets can self-repair themselves. And the game goes on an infinite loop. The reason we did so is related to the current COVID situation that is a form of an Easter egg element in the game. 
 Here is a brief explanation on it:  
1)	The mankind is suffering a lot due to this harmful disease and we decided to symbolise this in game.  
2)	As player represents the hardworking and dedicated health worker and turrets are the viruses to defeat.  
3)	Respawning means that even if the virus has been eliminated, it can again come back if we neglect it. Thus there is a constant war between the player and turrets.
